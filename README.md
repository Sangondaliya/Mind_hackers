# Back Study
Over the years, studies conducted on development of children and education, sociology, physiology and special education have resulted in advancement of their growth and achieve greater self-esteem and social fulfilment and acceptance by personal nurturing in the least restrictive environment and them being involved in their community. 
	The objectives of integrated education:
1.	Provide the same opportunities and experiences for blind or visually impaired children as that of sighted children.
2.	Allow blind children – and their families, neighbours, and friends – to interact socially.
Integrated education is not simply placing a child in a regular classroom. The children can assimilate more than 80% of the teaching in the class if they are provided with the correct material in the correct form at the correct time. 

Closed captions were originally developed to halep the hearing impaired. Language learners performed significantly better in objective vocabulary testing when they watched videos with closed captions compared to when they did not watch videos without closed captions.
